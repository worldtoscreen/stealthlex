### What's this?

Introducing the BCI (Better Celex Injector), the ultimate solution to enhance your Celex experience. Designed to optimize your gameplay, the BCI is your go-to injector for Celex, ensuring a smoother and more authentic gaming experience. Say goodbye to crashes and hello to seamless gameplay, all while making your sessions more legit and streamable. With the BCI, you'll be able to level up your Celex adventures, guaranteeing a smoother ride and an enhanced visual appeal that's sure to impress both you and your audience. (I have renamed it to stealthlex)

### General Info

BCI is free and will always be free (you can donate for perks)

GitHub will be up soon!

Features:

Fix Crashes
Comparable with any web Roblox (including bloxstrap)
Inject on keybind
Un-Inject on keybind
Clean ALL celex & stealthlex traces on keybind
Audio indicators for everything listed above
JSON Configuration
Easy setup - you are guided throught the whole process. After setup, you won't be able to configure again and stealthlex will be a background process. You'll need to manually delete the json config to configure it again.

### Main Goal

The undetectability of celex with added convenience and the ability to bypass screenshare checks.
